I studied Economics at the Catholic University of Bolivia and received my Ph.D. from Georgetown University. My research interests are in the areas of Labor Economics, Structural Econometrics, and Macroeconomics with emphasis on the computational aspects. I am an Assistant Professor and Director of the  Master Program in Economics (MAE) in the Department of Economics (ILADES) at Universidad Alberto Hurtado. In the past, I worked as an Instructor in the areas of macroeconomics and econometrics at Georgetown University, the University of Chile, and the Private University of Bolivia.
