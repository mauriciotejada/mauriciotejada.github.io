	pattern of Âglass ceilingsÂ over the period. We use a semiparametric
	method to decompose the wage gap on changes in characteristics and
	changes in prices, and we also correct for selection of women into
	the labor market. Thus, we come to the conclusion that most of the
	wage gap is due to differences in prices. When we correct for selection,
	we find that the wage gap could have been greater suggesting that
	there is positive selection of females into the labor market. This
	selection is more prominent for females with low education and in

	The results show that the proportion of prejudiced employers is estimated
	to be decreasing at an increasing speed, going from about 69\% in
	1985 to about 32\% in 2005. Therefore prejudice is not estimated
	to be a relevant factor in explaining the slower convergence between

	plays in setting the wage and the gender composition, we examine
	whether a competitive compensation regime, by itself, can cause differential
	job entry. The data highlight the power of the compensation regime
	in that women disproportionately shy away from competitive work settings.
	Yet, there are important factors that attenuate the gender differences,

	has overt gender associations, and the age of the job-seekers. We

	identified: the portion of the gap attributed to gender differences
	in human-capital resources; labor supply; sociodemographic attributes;
	occupational segregation; and the unexplained portion of the gap.
	The findings reveal a substantial reduction in the gross gender earnings
	gap in both sectors of the economy. Most of the decline is attributed
	to the reduction in the unexplained portion of the gap, implying
	a significant decline in economic discrimination against women. In
	contrast to discrimination, the role played by human capital and
	personal attributes in explaining the gender pay gap is relatively
	small in both sectors. Differences between the two sectors are not
	only in the size and pace of the reduction but also in the significance
	of the two major sources of the gap. Working hours have become the
	most important factor with respect to gender pay inequality in both
	sectors, although much more dominantly in the private sector. The
	declining gender segregation may explain the decreased impact of
	occupations on the gender pay gap in the private sector. In the public
	sector, by contrast, gender segregation still accounts for a substantial
	portion of the gap. The findings are discussed in light of the theoretical
	literature on sources of gender economic inequality and in light

  abstract  = {Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) microdata over the 1980-2010 period, we provide new empirical evidence on the extent of and trends in the gender wage gap, which declined considerably during this time. By 2010, conventional human capital variables taken together explained little of the gender wage gap, while gender differences in occupation and industry continued to be important. Moreover, the gender pay gap declined much more slowly at the top of the wage distribution than at the middle or bottom and by 2010 was noticeably higher at the top. We then survey the literature to identify what has been learned about the explanations for the gap. We conclude that many of the traditional explanations continue to have salience. Although human-capital factors are now relatively unimportant in the aggregate, women's work force interruptions and shorter hours remain significant in high-skilled occupations, possibly due to compensating differentials. Gender differences in occupations and industries, as well as differences in gender roles and the gender division of labor remain important, and research based on experimental evidence strongly suggests that discrimination cannot be discounted. Psychological attributes or noncognitive skills comprise one of the newer explanations for gender differences in outcomes. Our effort to assess the quantitative evidence on the importance of these factors suggests that they account for a small to moderate portion of the gender pay gap, considerably smaller than, say, occupation and industry effects, though they appear to modestly contribute to these differences.

  abstract  = {Understanding whether labor market discrimination explains inferior labor market outcomes for many groups has drawn the attention of labor economists for decades-- at least since the publication of Gary Beckers The Economics of Discrimination in 1957. The decades of research on discrimination in labor markets began with a regression-based decomposition approach, asking whether raw wage or earnings differences between groups--which might constitute prima facie evidence of discrimination--were in fact attributable to other productivity-related factors. Subsequent research--responding in large part to limitations of the regression-based approach--moved on to other approaches, such as using firm-level data to estimate both marginal productivity and wage differentials. In recent years, however, there has been substantial growth in experimental research on labor market discrimination--although the earliest experiments were done decades ago. Some experimental research on labor market discrimination takes place in the lab. But far more of it is done in the field, which makes this particular area of experimental research unique relative to the explosion of experimental economic research more generally. This paper surveys the full range of experimental literature on labor market discrimination, places it in the context of the broader research literature on labor market discrimination, discusses the experimental literature from many different perspectives (empirical, theoretical, and policy), and reviews both what this literature has taught us thus far, and what remains to be done.

Yet only half of women in the region are paid for or otherwise profit from their work. Work without formal pay leads to weak protection of human rights and limits civic participation. Moreover, gender inequality deters economic development and fosters income inequality. Research shows gender gaps result from the interactions of social norms and biological differences. The challenges to generating effective policies include the difficulty of identifying relevant mechanisms to explain gaps, the cost of collecting and analyzing relevant data, and the complexity associated with determining pertinent features of gender gaps. Collection and analysis of those mechanisms, data, and features are critical to learning how to correct gender gaps going forward.},

abstract = {Self-employed workers account for between 8 and 30 {\%} of participants in the labor markets of OECD countries (Blanchower, Self-employment: more may not be better, 2004). This paper develops and estimates a general equilibrium model of the labor market that accounts for this sizable proportion. The model incorporates self-employed workers, some of whom hire paid employees in the market. Employment rates and earnings distributions are determined endogenously and are estimated to match their empirical counterparts. The model is estimated using the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). The model is able to estimate nonpecuniary amenities associated with employment in different labor market states, accounting for both different employment dynamics within state and the misreporting of earnings by self-employed workers. Structural parameter estimates are then used to assess the impact of an increase in the generosity of unemployment benefits on the aggregate employment rate. Findings suggest that modeling the self-employed, some of whom hire paid employees implies that small increases in unemployment benefits leads to an expansion in aggregate employment.

The human capital is accumulated while working but depreciates while searching for a job. Jobs can be formal or informal. The model is estimated on labor market data for Mexico. Human capital accumulation is responsible for more than half of the overall value of production, and upgrades more quickly while working formally than informally. Policy experiments reveal that human capital accumulation magnifies the negative impact on productivity of the labor market institutions that give rise to informality.},

  abstract={Using 2005 firm level data for 26 countries in Eastern and Central Europe, this paper estimates performance gaps between male and female-owned businesses, while controlling for location by industry and country. The findings show that female entrepreneurs have a significantly smaller scale of operations (as measured by sales revenues) and are less efficient in terms of total factor productivity, although the difference is small. However, women entrepreneurs generate the same amount of profit per unit of revenue as men. Although both male and female entrepreneurs in the region are sub-optimally small, women's returns to scale are significantly larger than men's, implying that women would gain more from increasing their scale. The authors argue that the main reasons for the sub-optimal size of female-owned firms are that they are both capital constrained and concentrated in industries with small firms.},

abstract = {An influential recent literature argues that women are less likely to initiate bargaining with their employers and are (often) less effective negotiators than men. We use longitudinal wage data from Portugal, matched to balance sheet information on employers, to measure the relative bargaining power of men and women and assess the impact of the gender gap in bargaining strength on the male-female wage gap. We show that a model with additive fixed effects for workers and gender-specific fixed effects for firms provides a close approximation to the wage structure for both men and women. Building on this model we present three complementary approaches to identifying the impact of differential bargaining strength. First, we perform a simple decomposition by assigning the firm-specific wage premiums for one gender to the other. Second, we relate the wage premiums for men and women to measures of employer profitability. Third, we show that changes in firm-specific profitability have a smaller effect on the wage growth of female than male employees. All three approaches suggest that women are paid only 85-90{\%} of the premiums that men earn at more profitable firms. Overall, we estimate that the shortfall in women‘s relative bargaining power explains around 3 percentage points – or 10-15{\%} – of the gender wage gap in Portugal.},

 abstract = {There is growing evidence that firm-specific pay premiums are an important source of wage inequality. These premiums will contribute to the gender wage gap if women are less likely to work at high-paying firms or if women negotiate (or are offered) worse wage bargains with their employers than men. Using longitudinal data on the hourly wages of Portuguese workers matched with income statement information for firms, we show that the wages of both men and women contain firm-specific premiums that are strongly correlated with simple measures of the potential bargaining surplus at each firm. We then show how the impact of these firm-specific pay differentials on the gender wage gap can be decomposed into a combination of sorting and bargaining effects. We find that women are less likely to work at firms that pay higher premiums to either gender, with sorting effects being most important for low- and middle-skilled workers. We also find that women receive only 90\% of the firm-specific pay premiums earned by men. Importantly, we find the same gender gap in the responses of wages to changes in potential surplus over time. Taken together, the combination of sorting and bargaining effects explain about one-fifth of the cross-sectional gender wage gap in Portugal.},
